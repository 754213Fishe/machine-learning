# Ocademy self-paced assignments

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/open-academy/assignments-binder-requirements/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fopen-academy%252Fmachine-learning%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Fmachine-learning%252F%26branch%3Dmain)

Ocademy sets up the assignment as [Test-driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) style. The questions are [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) alike, implemented as a bunch of Jupyter Notebooks, and visualized by [jupyterlab-pytutor](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-pytutor). A real-world code quality assurance environment is simulated. You will learn how to handle software testing while working on the assignments.
