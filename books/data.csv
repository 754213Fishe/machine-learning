1fc91e11-e69b-45e9-990a-6db9801087ac,Neural Networks and Deep Learning,"Neural Networks and Deep Learning is a free online book. The book will teach you about:

- Neural networks, a beautiful biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data
- Deep learning, a powerful set of techniques for learning in neural networks

Neural networks and deep learning currently provide the best solutions to many problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This book will teach you many of the core concepts behind neural networks and deep learning.","Michael Nielsen ",http://michaelnielsen.org/,http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/,free,deep learning,en_US,advanced,"machine learning,AI,deep learning",CC BY-NC 3.0,2014-12-01,2023-08-05T12:37:59T+085,2023-08-05T12:37:59T+085

This historical survey compactly summarises relevant work, much of it from the previous millennium. Shallow and deep learners are distinguished by the depth of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning & evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.",Jurgen Schmidhuber,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Schmidhuber,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.7828v4.pdf,free,deep learning,en_US,advanced,"machine learning,AI,deep learning",,2014-08-08,2023-08-05T12:37:59T+085,2023-08-05T12:37:59T+085
