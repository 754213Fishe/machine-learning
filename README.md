### Interactive Online Textbook

This [Online Textbook](https://open-academy.github.io/machine-learning/intro.html) is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, from the fundamentals to the latest advanced techniques, with a focus on practical applications. It is intended for developers, data scientists, engineers, and anyone who wants to learn how to use machine learning to solve real-world problems.

It is divided into four main parts. 

- Chap 1 covers the prerequisites, including an introduction to Python programming and its advanced concepts.
- Chap 2 focuses on the data science lifecycle, from data acquisition to data visualization, and introduces the best practices for working with data in the cloud.
- Chap 3 covers the fundamentals of machine learning, including regression, classification, and model deployment.
- Chap 4 covers advanced machine learning techniques, such as clustering, ensemble learning, and deep learning.
- â€¦

Each chapter includes **theoretical concepts**, **hands-on exercises**, and **real-world examples** to help you develop a solid understanding of the topic. By the end of the textbook, you will have the knowledge and skills to build and deploy machine learning models in a production environment.

### Curriculum

We are committed to delivering high-quality and practical courses on schedule every week, featuring instructors from both academia and industry, including technical experts from leading technology companies. Currently, we have completed the section on Data Science and are now in progress with the Machine Learning section. Due to limited capacity and venue availability, the course will be conducted online via [online textbook](https://open-academy.github.io/machine-learning/intro.html) and [VooV (Tencent) meeting](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/tvm), and at this time, we are only accepting students who are proficient in Chinese (although we plan to address this issue in the future). Please find the class schedule below.

| Time | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
