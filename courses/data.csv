This summer school will review recent developments in feature learning and learning representations, with a particular emphasis on “deep learning” methods, which can learn multi-layer hierarchies of representations.

Topics will include unsupervised learning methods such as stacked restricted Boltzmann machines, sparse coding, denoising auto-encoders, and methods for learning over-complete representations; supervised methods for deep architectures, metric learning criteria for vector-space embeddings; deep convolutional architectures and their applications to images, video, audio, and text; compositional hierarchies and latent-variable models.

Mathematical issues will be addressed, particularly how to characterize the low-dimensional structure of natural data in high-dimensional spaces; training density models with intractable partition functions; the geometry of non-convex and ill-conditioned loss functions for deep learning; efficient optimization methods for inference and deep learning; the representational efficiency of deep architectures, and the advantages of high-dimensional and over-complete representations.
