99e0b42f-2106-4c2c-bd5e-74062dff80c2,Data Visualization,"Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.

In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.

You'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface).",,,,https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/,free,data science,,"data science,data visualization,javascript,projects",freeCodeCamp,https://freecodecamp.org,self-paced,true,en_US,beginner,,2023-07-30T00:42:47T+0830,2023-07-30T00:43:22T+0830
de4b6035-6804-4afe-a755-5585c13b87f6,Relational Database,"For these courses, you will use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, you will learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.

Next, you will learn how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.

Finally, you will learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.",,,,https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/,free,data science,,"data science,SQL,projects",freeCodeCamp,https://freecodecamp.org,self-paced,true,en_US,beginner,,2023-07-30T00:43:06T+0830,2023-07-30T00:43:12T+0830
32506d90-7d95-4db1-837b-f658812b9c4e,Scientific Computing with Python,"Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.",,Charles Severance,https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesseverance/,https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/,free,data science,,"data science,python,projects,video",freeCodeCamp,https://freecodecamp.org,self-paced,true,en_US,beginner,,2023-07-30T00:43:06T+0830,2023-07-30T00:43:12T+0830
2bf12255-e5ce-4a69-98bf-ad2b729bc9c2,Data Analysis with Python,"Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.",,Santiago Basulto,https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiagobasulto,https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/,free,data science,,"data science,python,projects,video",freeCodeCamp,https://freecodecamp.org,self-paced,true,en_US,beginner,,2023-07-30T00:43:06T+0830,2023-07-30T00:43:12T+0830
c365a193-10b8-4eaf-a17e-f61946a59895,Machine Learning with Python,"Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job.

In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.

19b81252-2c3f-4af9-b796-8bf215a909a5,College Algebra with Python,"This course is designed as a one-semester college course. It consists of instructional videos, with Google Colaboratory notebooks to follow along interactively, assignments, and challenging projects.

As you go through each part of this course in sequence, you will gain a full understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve Algebra problems.

Throughout this course, you will also build your own Algebra Colab notebook that you will be able to use as your custom calculator. This course (and the code you write here) will give you the foundation for a deeper math and data science understanding.",,,,https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/college-algebra-with-python/,free,data science,,"data science,python,math,projects,video",freeCodeCamp,https://freecodecamp.org,self-paced,true,en_US,beginner,,2023-07-30T00:42:47T+0830,2023-07-30T00:43:22T+0830
